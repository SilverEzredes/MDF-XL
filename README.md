- Changes can be saved to a preset that can be switched to at any time when that piece of gear is equipped. The last selected preset will also persist between game sessions and auto-load either after a loading screen (if the gear is still in use) or after equipping the gear through the equipment menu.

- A custom non-replacer base body that's split into more than 50 parts. Available for both male and female Hunters, it allows you to fill in gaps created by hiding submeshes.
